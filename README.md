# MKStream

MKStream allows people to send files directly to each other through a secured and anonymous data-channel established by WebRTC's peer-connection. You can use our service across multiple browsers and acrosss multiple platforms with no plugins, no downloads, and no installs necessary.

## How to use MKStream
**1. Upload files  |**  Visit [MKStream.club](https://www.mkstream.club/) and upload your file(s) by clicking the drop-zone and/or dragging and dropping a file into the drop-zone.

**2. Share link  |**  After choosing your file(s), MKStream creates a anonymous and temporary unique url used to transfer files in the browser. Clicking on the glowing lightning bolt below the drop-zone will copy the temporary url to your clipboard. Give this link to another person to establish a connection and begin transfering.

**3. Transfer data  |**  Your url and your file(s) will be available for transfer as long as you keep your MKStream tab open. When both people have the unique url loaded, a file will appear in your receiving section. Clicking accept on a file begins the transfer and readies it for you to download. While connected, feel fre

**Note:**   
For anonymity and security reasons, either peer closing or refreshing their MKStream tab destroys the connection and voids the current anonymous link. To share more files, just go back to [MKStream.club](https://www.mkstream.club/) and MKStream will be ready for you any time.
